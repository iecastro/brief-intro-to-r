## What we will cover today

- Just the tip of the iceberg...

- There's not enough time to cover everything

- The content presented today is largely based on the [Data science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/content/explore/) materials

- Given our roles, we will focus on:
  1. How to start interacting with R  
  
  2. How to wrangle data in R  

--

Things we won't cover today, but I'll gladly help you with otherwise:

- Advanced data wrangling
- Data visualization
- Data modelling
- Handling spatial data

---

## Who Am I?

- Coordinator in Dr. Possemato's lab

- Fairly new to CIH (less than a year)

- Learned R (largely on my own) during graduate school 

- Trained in biostats

- Enjoy working with messy data

# Reproducible data wrangling and analysis

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integreated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>➥</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/engine-dashboard.png")
```

## Let's take a tour - R / RStudio

.center[
![](../img/demo.png)
]

Concepts introduced:

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions

---

## R essentials

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)

```

--

- For this project we'll need the following packages: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "devtools", "datasauRus", "fivethirtyeight", "janitor"))
```
--
---

## tidyverse

.pull-left[
![](img/tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
.center[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
]

- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

# R Markdown

---


## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## Let's take a tour - R Markdown


.center[
![](../img/demo.png)
]

Concepts introduced:

- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

---

## `r fontawesome::fa("laptop")`  Bechdel Test 

.question[
What is the Bechdel test?
]

--

The Bechdel test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, and there must be two women named characters.

--

- Go to RStudio Cloud and open the application exercise (AE-02).
- Knit the R Markdown document.

---

## Other things you can make in R markdown

`r fontawesome::fa("file-powerpoint")` These slides
`r fontawesome::fa("file")` [HTML resume](https://iecastro.github.io/web-resume)
`r fontawesome::fa("link")` [Web link](https://iecastro.github.io/blog/2018-09-13/ndi-dist-prof.html)

## Workspaces

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with R Markdown: The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console!

- Run the following in the console
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```
.question[
All looks good, eh?
]

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document
```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```
.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Workshop tutorials are in R Markdown documents
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with

# Git and GitHub

---

## Version control

- GitHub as a platform for collaboration
- It's actually desiged for version control

---

## Versioning

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = 1200}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lego-steps.png")
```

---

## Versioning 

with human readable messages

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = 1200}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lego-steps-commit-messages.png")
```

---

## Why do we need version control?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

---

# Git and GitHub tips

- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids. GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better).

--
- There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

--
- __This is outside the scope of this workshop and I've found difficult to set up in a VA computer.__

--
- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/).
